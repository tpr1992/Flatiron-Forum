### Flatiron Forum

- Please run `rails s` on port 3000 to run the project. For testing purposes, you may either create a new account, or use the following credentials: Username: `test`, Password: `123456`

- This is my mod 2 project from Flatiron School. It is built entirely in Rails and is inspired by Reddit and other forum style platforms.

- Sessions are used to authenticate users.

- Users can view the profiles of others, as well as their recent activity. Recent activity includes the posting of topics, replies, or comments. Using a rails algorithm, all topics/replies/comments are properly sorted and organized.

This project is still somewhat of a work in progress and the styling is not yet set in stone. Please let me know if you have any further suggestions or would like to contribute. Thank you!
